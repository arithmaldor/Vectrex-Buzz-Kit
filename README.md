# Buzz Fix Kit
Use this board to make assembly of the buzz fix kit a bit easier. I have included an SMD version as well as a THT version. The THT version can be used with the
kit sold on Console5.com here:https://console5.com/store/vectrex-de-buzz-kit.html

See https://console5.com/wiki/Vectrex_PreAmp_Buzz_Reduction for more informationa about the circuit.
